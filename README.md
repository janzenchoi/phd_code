# PhD Code

The following contains a collection of repositories I developed during my PhD candidature. I originally maintained the code on the GitHub organisation for the material modelling group at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO; https://github.com/ACME-MG). However, it has now been moved to my account for storage. Please contact me at janzenchoi@yahoo.com for any questions regarding the code.

# Summary

The table below summarises these repositories.
